                    Over the last three years, Sri Lanka's population has grown gradually, with an average annual
                    increase of about 0.25%. The growth rate has been slowing slightly, reflecting demographic
                    transitions such as lower birth rates.

                    Sinhala (69%) and Tamil (25.2%) are the primary languages of most Sri Lankans. Other ethnic groups
                    include the Malayalam, the Ambalavasi, the Mapilla, the Telugu, the Vaddars and the Waggai. Other
                    languages have very few speakers (approximately just 300 people speak vedda). English is widely
                    spoken.

                    Sri Lanka's beauty lies in its rich tapestry of diverse nations, where multiple cultures, languages,
                    and religions coexist harmoniously. The population is composed of 74.9% Sinhalese, who are
                    predominantly Buddhist, 15.3% Tamils, including 11.2% Sri Lankan Tamils and 4.1% Indian Tamils,
                    mostly Hindus, 9.3% Moors, a Muslim community, and 0.5% Burghers, Malays, and others. This diversity
                    fosters a unique blend of traditions, art, and cuisine, enhancing the island's cultural charm. These
                    groups reflect the nation's rich ethnic and religious heritage, contributing to Sri Lanka's vibrant
                    identity.

                    Sri Lanka is predominantly Buddhist, with 70.2% of the population practicing Buddhism, mainly among
                    the Sinhalese. The island also has a significant Hindu population, making up 12.6%, mostly among
                    Tamils, followed by 9.7% Muslims (Moors), and 7.4% Christians, including both Roman Catholics and
                    Protestants. This religious diversity plays a vital role in shaping Sri Lanka’s cultural and social
                    dynamics.

                    ‘Poya Day’ means ‘day of the full moon’: after Buddha was born, he experienced enlightenment and
                    died on the day of the full moon of May (Vesak Poya). Therefore, all Poya Days are holidays in Sri
                    Lanka: Buddhists dress up in white and visit temples to make offerings of flowers and incense and to
                    meditate.

                <p class="topic-description">
                    Sri Lanka's history dates back over 2,500 years, with early kingdoms such as Anuradhapura and
                    Polonnaruwa marking the island's cultural and political development. It was influenced by Buddhism
                    from India, which became deeply ingrained in the society, and the island saw multiple invasions from
                    South India. The colonial era began with the Portuguese in the 16th century, followed by the Dutch
                    and finally the British, who ruled Sri Lanka until gaining independence in 1948.
                    <br>
                    Post-independence, Sri Lanka faced internal challenges, including ethnic tensions between the
                    Sinhalese-majority and Tamil-minority, leading to a brutal civil war from 1983 to 2009. The war
                    ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, but its legacy continues to impact the nation. Today, Sri
                    Lanka is a democratic republic, balancing its rich cultural heritage with modernization efforts.

                    Sri Lankan gastronomy is knockout, shaped with a superb natural larder (seafood, tropical fruits,
                    and bold spices). In very simple terms, rice and curry are the basis of Sri Lankan cuisine, with the
                    addition of meat or fish, various condiments and vegetables. Talking of condiments, sambol is
                    incredibly popular – a delicious mish-mash of coconut flesh whizzed up with grated pepper and spices
                    – often eaten with rice, or with bread for breakfast. Other popular dishes include Kiribath (rice
                    cooked in coconut milk), served with a sprinkling of sesame seeds; cutlets (spicy croquettes) are
                    deep-fried potato and fish balls; and biriyani is a Muslim specialty (rice, chicken or mutton or
                    beef, thick with spices and topped with hard-boiled egg). For breakfast, go for the hoppers - rice
                    pancakes made from rice flour and coconut milk, with a spicy side of dhal, curry and sambol.
                    Vegetables and fruits are in abundance, too. Need something sweet? Order a memorable curd and
                    treacle (buffalo milk curd with treacle).

                    Sri Lanka offers a variety of refreshing drinks that reflect its cultural richness. Coconut water is
                    a popular natural beverage, often enjoyed fresh from the coconut. Ceylon tea, globally renowned, is
                    a staple in the country, served both hot and iced. Other local favorites include King Coconut water,
                    a sweeter variety of coconut water, and Rasakinda, a sweet, spicy drink made from herbs and spices.
                    The island also offers fruit-based drinks like Wood Apple juice and Lime juice, providing a burst of
                    tropical flavors.
